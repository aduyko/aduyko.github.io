<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm Andriy Duyko, a fourth-year Computer Science student at Stony Brook University in New York. 
  In the time that I've spent writing code and developing software for my classes, I've found that what 
  I enjoy more than anything is web development: It's quick, flexible, and capable of reaching millions 
  upon millions of people. I started writing web applications with simple HTML 5 games after joining the 
  Stony Brook Game Developers club on campus. My games helped me obtain a summer internship at Creative 
  Dynamics working on mongasso.com, and I'm now one of the managing members of the Game Developers club. 
  In my free time, I draw, read, play guitar, and work out, but what I like to do more than anything is 
  work on cool programming ideas that I have.
